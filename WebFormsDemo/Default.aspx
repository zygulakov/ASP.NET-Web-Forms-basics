        Facts About Ants</h1>
        <p>
            Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and,<br/>
            along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order<br/>
            Hymenoptera. Ants appear in the fossil record across the globe<br/>
            in considerable diversity during the latest Early Cretaceous and<br/>
            early Late Cretaceous, suggesting an earlier origin. Ants evolved<br/>
            from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period, and diversified<br/>
            after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated<br/>
            total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified<br/>
            by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that<br/>
            forms their slender waists.<br/>
